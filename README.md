# CSDE_DOCS
This repository contains a Corda application built with Corda 5.1 and Kotlin, designed to handle consent forms. The project is structured into several modules and directories to facilitate the development, deployment, and maintenance of the application.

Project Structure

Contracts
The contracts module defines the smart contracts for the consent forms. These contracts specify the rules and conditions under which the consent forms are managed and enforced on the blockchain with the correponding states.

Workflows
The workflows module contains the flows, or workflows, that outline the step-by-step procedures for creating, updating, and verifying consent forms. These workflows ensure that all parties involved in the process adhere to the defined flows.
